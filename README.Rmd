{ggannotate} makes it easy to add annotations to your {ggplot2} plots by pointing and clicking.

Annotations are often the most important part of a data visualisation, but getting them in exactly the right place can be fiddly. 

**{ggannotate} launches an interactive Shiny gadget that lets you click on your plot to place annotations exactly where you want them.** It then generates the code to reproduce your annotations

![Demo of ggannotate](man/figures/demo.gif)

## Features

- Add **text**, **labels**, **curves**, and **rectangles** to any ggplot2 plot
- Place multiple annotations in a single session
- Full support for faceted plots
- Annotations using the same geom are combined into a single layer for cleaner code
- Copy generated code to the clipboard with one click
- Use as an RStudio addin or call directly from the console

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("MattCowgill/ggannotate")
```

## Usage

Firs, create a ggplot2 object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggannotate)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

```

Then just call `ggannotate()` or use the handy RStudio addin to invoke ggannotate.

It also works with named plots:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

ggannotate(p)
```

This launches a Shiny app where you can add your annotations interactively. When you're done, click "Copy code" to copy the annotation code to your clipboard, then paste it into your script.
